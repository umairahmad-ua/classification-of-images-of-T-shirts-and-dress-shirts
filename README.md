# classification-of-images-of-T-shirts-and-dress-shirts
We have given 12000 training examples of shirts and t-shirts as a grey scale images, I have extracted  the feature by applying state of the art edge detection technique which is known as Canny dge  detection, because for this problem we donâ€™t have any need to understand the inside edge features  color, size, and object inside but only the edge boundaries are enough to understand either its shirt or  t-shirt.  I have also implemented the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature explainer mostly  used in image processing and computer vision for object detection. This technique counts occurrences  of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image. For this problem object is detected and  features are extracted via gradient. We will see the difference and performance of both techniques but  before that here is the examples of how extracted features may look alike
